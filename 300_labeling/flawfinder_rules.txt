chown	5	This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a race condition results. (CWE-362)
chroot	3	chroot can be very helpful, but is hard to use correctly (CWE-250, CWE-22)
crypt	4	The crypt functions use a poor one-way hashing algorithm; since they only accept passwords of 8 characters or fewer and only a two-byte salt, they are excessively vulnerable to dictionary attacks given today's faster computing equipment (CWE-327)
crypt_r	4	The crypt functions use a poor one-way hashing algorithm; since they only accept passwords of 8 characters or fewer and only a two-byte salt, they are excessively vulnerable to dictionary attacks given today's faster computing equipment (CWE-327)

cuserid	4	Exactly what cuserid() does is poorly defined (e.g., some systems use the effective uid, like Linux, while others like System V use the real uid). Thus, you can't trust what it does. It's certainly not portable (The cuserid function was included in the 1988 version of POSIX, but removed from the 1990 version).  Also, if passed a non-null parameter, there's a risk of a buffer overflow if the passed-in buffer is not at least L_cuserid characters long (CWE-120)

fopen	2	Check when opening files - can an attacker redirect it (via symlinks), force the opening of special file type (e.g., device files), move things around to create a race condition, control its ancestors, or change its contents? (CWE-362)
fprintf	4	If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited (CWE-134)
fread	0	Function accepts input from outside program (CWE-20)
fscanf	4	The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20)

getlogin	4	It's often easy to fool getlogin.  Sometimes it does not work at all, because some program messed up the utmp file.  Often, it gives only the first 8 characters of the login name. The user currently logged in on the controlling tty of our program need not be the user who started it.  Avoid getlogin() for security-related purposes (CWE-807)

getopt_long	3	Some older implementations do not protect against internal buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20)

What it does exactly varies considerably between systems, particularly in where its prompt is displayed and where it gets its data (e.g., /dev/tty, stdin, stderr, etc.). In addition, some implementations overflow buffers. (CWE-676, CWE-120, CWE-20)
getpw	4	This function is dangerous; it may overflow the provided buffer. It extracts data from a 'protected' area, but most systems have many commands to let users modify the protected area, and it's not always clear what their limits are.  Best to avoid using this function altogether (CWE-676, CWE-120)

getwd	3	This does not protect against buffer overflows by itself, so use with caution (CWE-120, CWE-20)

lstrncat	4	Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination [MS-banned] (CWE-120)
memalign	1	On some systems (though not Linux-based systems) an attempt to free() results from memalign() may fail. This may, on a few systems, be exploitable.  Also note that memalign() may not check that the boundary parameter is correct (CWE-676)
memcpy	2	Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120)
mismatch	1	Function does not check the second iterator for over-read conditions (CWE-126)
mkstemp	2	Potential for temporary file vulnerability in some circumstances.  Some older Unix-like systems create temp files with permission to write by all by default, so be sure to set the umask to override this. Also, some older Unix systems might fail to use O_EXCL when opening the file, so make sure that O_EXCL is used by the library (CWE-377)
mktemp	4	Temporary file race condition (CWE-377)
mrand48	3	This function is not sufficiently random for security-related functions such as key and nonce creation (CWE-327)

read	1	Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops (CWE-120, CWE-20)

readv	0	Function accepts input from outside program (CWE-20)
realpath	3	This function does not protect against buffer overflows, and some implementations can overflow internally (CWE-120/CWE-785!)
